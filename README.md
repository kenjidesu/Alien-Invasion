In *Alien Invasion*, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen.
The player can move the ship up, down, right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the
spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and move across and down the screen.
Then player shoots and destroy aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that
moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the
screen, the players loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
